### Overview
Minecraft, a muiltiplayer adventure-like computer game, puts players into an infinitely and randomly generated world in which they can harvest resources, build structures, and craft new items. Each player model is wrapped in a 64 x 64 pixel skin which each player can either download from the internet or custom themselves using one of the readily available online skin editing tools. <br>

In this project I aim to answer two very big questions:
1. Looking at a large dataset of these Minecraft skins, are they clustered together in any way?
2. Are we able to use each skin's raw data to generate new Minecraft skins?
