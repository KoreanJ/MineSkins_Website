### Visuals
Using the VGG16 convolutional neural network, I extracted features from a sample of 40 test images. The features vector were then reduced into 2 dimensions using UMAP, which allowed me to visualize each skin in the scatter plot shown below. As we can see from this sample of 40 test images, there doesn't appear to be a clear clustering behavior among the skins.
