### Looking Forward
This project could have been taken in many different directions, but such work could have only been accomplished with more time. One of the most fascinating points to address in the future would be to analyze how the DCGAN might be able to understand an additional added dimension. All Minecraft skins were originally stored with 4 color channels but during the training process each image was cast into an RGB image object. This actually improved the results since it didn't need to understand the additional alpha measure that identifies which pieces should show on the wrapped up skin. <br>

Another interesting application of this project would be to try and create a skin using only skins from a specific class label. For example, only looking at spiderman skins and analyzing the results to see how accurately the DCGAN could identify features of a "spiderman" skin.
